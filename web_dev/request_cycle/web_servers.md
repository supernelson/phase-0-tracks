LINUX Design Philosophy
The creators of the Unix operating system started with a radical concept: they assumed that the user of their operating system would be computer literate from the start. The entire Unix philosophy revolves around the idea that the user knows what he or she is doing.
Unix was not designed to stop its users from doing stupid things, as that would also stop them from doing clever things.

Linux Prime Directive: Treat all users with respect.

VPS is your own virtual machine that you can time share. It is a great sandbox environment to test things out in.

Linux is bad to run in Root because it defeats the security model that's been in place for years. Its just good practice on any operating system to run your applications on a user level and leave administrative tasks to the root user, and only on a per-need basis.
