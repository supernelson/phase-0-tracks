2. Scan through them to figure out which ones are best.(5m)
YouTube: video
JQFundamentals: google ranking
W3School: light dry run
Code Academy: deeper DIY

3. Identify my top 3. (10m)
Things i noticed:
"The jQuery library makes it easy to manipulate a page of HTML after it's displayed by the browser."
$ equals JQuery function (shorthand)
javascript
Easiest & most popular JS library, widely used
Add script src of script.js
Animates websites! Gives it the sangria.

4. Spend a pomodoro to cover all three.
Looking at notations and steps
- add SRC
- memorize the basic structure below...
$(document).ready(function(){
    $("p").click(function(){
        $(this).hide();
    });
});

5. Identify the big JQuery topics at high level.
Chaining - cool to layer multiple actions with timing.
User Events - responsiveness

Good categorization https://oscarotero.com/jquery/

5x MENTAL BREAK (15m)

6. Spend the remaining time digging into topics of interest. (20m)
Having a look at awarded/cool JQuery sites

Release 1 : Post-Op Self Assessment
1. Create a list of web resources. Use different keywords. Found sources that I know view with quality.

2. Scan through them to figure out which ones are best. I used a variety of media types to give me different mixes of education to hedge my learning & keep it fresh ADHD style. Video, audio, read, DIY.

3. Identify my top 3. Dove straight into videos to see it in action. I realized I didn't know what JQuery is as a concept so I'm backing up.

4. Spend a pomodoro to cover all three. Learning a good bit but it's not sinking in without Hand On. The structure is there but I'm not exactly sure of all the bits.

5. Identify the big JQuery topics at high level.
Turns out JQuery is more learn by doing than topical. So I'm starting to dig into the hand on.

5x At this point (1 hour mark I feel my awareness & focus slipping away).

6. Spend the remaining time digging into topics of interest.
OK now onto doing it! DIY and Code Academy

Overall it was great carefully track my 2 hour time usage. I noticed the "rush" of being timed. I got a ton done in the first hour, second hour I dropped off.
