# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a rolling history of changes being made to files in a repository. Functions similar to Time Machine on Mac.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
branches give you the opportunity to work on existing code without endangering the original copy. It allows multiple people to work on the same "master" using separate branches which will be merged back together at some point.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
Commits allow you to save changes made to a branch. It's the final part of the staging.

* What is a merge conflict?
Merge conflicts arise when two changes are made to the same spot in same file while not being committed.
